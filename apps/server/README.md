# Welcome to Colyseus!

This project was created with [⚔️ `create-colyseus-app`](https://github.com/colyseus/create-colyseus-app/).

[Documentation](https://docs.colyseus.io/)

## :crossed_swords: Usage

```
npm start
```

Then open http://localhost:2567 for the playground, or /monitor for the monitor.

## Structure

- `src/index.ts`: entry point — leave it alone if you plan to deploy to Colyseus Cloud
- `src/app.config.ts`: server configuration — rooms, HTTP routes, express middleware
- `src/rooms/GameRoom.ts`: your room handler
- `src/rooms/schema/GameRoomState.ts`: the state synchronized to every client in the room
- `test/GameRoom.test.ts`: boots the real server and connects a real client
- `loadtest/example.ts`: scriptable client for `npm run loadtest`
- `ecosystem.config.cjs`: pm2 configuration, used when deploying to Colyseus Cloud

## Scripts

- `npm start`: run the server in watch mode (`tsx watch src/index.ts`)
- `npm test`: run the mocha test suite
- `npm run build`: compile to `build/`
- `npm run loadtest`: connect N simulated clients with [`@colyseus/loadtest`](https://github.com/colyseus/colyseus-loadtest/)

## What's included

### Turn-based

`GameRoom` owns the turn order: `state.currentTurn` names whose turn it is, and a
`play` message from anyone else is ignored. The room locks once it is full, and
each turn carries a deadline — a `clock.setTimeout` skips a player who runs out
the clock, so one idle client cannot stall the match.

`state.turnDeadline` is stamped from `this.clock.currentTime`, the room's own
clock, so a reconnecting client can render the remaining time without the server
sending a countdown.

### Reconnection

`GameRoom.onDrop()` holds a dropped client's seat for 30 seconds via
`allowReconnection()`. The SDK retries automatically with exponential backoff;
`onReconnect()` fires if it gets back in time, `onLeave()` if it does not.
